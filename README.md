- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

- Handling form data in a simple and efficient way
- Manipulate the DOM itself and HTML element's style using JavaScript
- Using regular expressions with JavaScript

Furthermore, I got some practice in using the TailwindCSS framework to style elements.
